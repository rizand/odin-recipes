    <h1>Nasi Goreng</h1>
    <img src="nasi-goreng.jpeg" alt="A picture of nasi goreng with garnish on a plate.">
    <p>Nasi Goreng is traditionally served with a fried egg and a side of fresh vegetables 
        (commonly plain juicy wedges of tomato and cucumber).</p>
    <p>
        Both these side options are very typical in various parts of Asia to add protein and
        vegetables to a plate to turn something carb-heavy into a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nasi Goreng is also a terrific Asian side dish option, something a little different
        that packs a bit flavour of punch!

        <li>1 medium carrot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 quantity Balinese spice paste</li>
        <li>1 table spoon tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 table spoon kecap manis</li>
        <li>1 table spoon light soy sauce</li>
        <li>8 spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To Serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>half cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>4 table spoon crispy fried onions</li>
        <li>prawn crackers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the rice in a medium heavy-based saucepan and add 520ml water. Quickly bring to the boil, stir once and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 mins. Uncover, fluff up with a fork and spread over a tray. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in the beaten egg and, as it begins to cook, use a spatula to bring large flakes of cooked egg into the middle of the omelette. Continue to cook like this for a couple of mins, then leave the rest of the egg to set completely. Flip the omelette over and transfer to a plate to cool before cutting it into long, thin shreds.</li>
        <li>Drop the beans into a pan of boiling salted water and cook for 3 mins. Drain, refresh under cold water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a wok or large, deep frying pan until almost smoking. Add the chicken and prawns, and stir-fry for 1 min. Tip in the shallots, garlic, chillies and carrots, and stir-fry for a further 2 mins until the carrot is just tender. Add the spice paste and stir-fry for 1 min more. Add the tomato pur√©e, kecap manis, cooked rice and green beans, and stir-fry over a high heat for 2 mins. Add the soy sauce, spring onions and shredded omelette, and toss together.</li>
        <li>Spoon the nasi goreng onto warmed plates. Overlap the cucumber and tomato on the side of each plate, sprinkle over the crispy fried onions and serve with prawn crackers.</li>
