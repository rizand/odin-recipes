    <p>Nasi Goreng is traditionally served with a fried egg and a side of fresh vegetables 
        (commonly plain juicy wedges of tomato and cucumber).</p>
    <p>
        Both these side options are very typical in various parts of Asia to add protein and
        vegetables to a plate to turn something carb-heavy into a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nasi Goreng is also a terrific Asian side dish option, something a little different
        that packs a bit flavour of punch!
